            How does Tailwind CSS differ from traditional CSS?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-answer">
            <p>
              Tailwind uses utility classes directly in your HTML, reducing the
              need for custom CSS and speeding up the design process.

            <p>
              Use semantic HTML, provide ARIA attributes, support keyboard

            What is the best way to structure a React project?

          <div class="accordion-answer">
            <p>
              Group related components into feature-based folders. Use hooks to
              separate logic and keep components small and focused.

            What is the virtual DOM in React?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-answer">
            <p>
              The virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the
              real DOM. React updates it first and efficiently syncs changes to
              the real DOM.

            How do I manage global state in a React app?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-answer">
            <p>
              Use Context API for simple cases. For complex state, use Redux,
              Zustand, Recoil, or other state management libraries.

            What is event delegation in JavaScript?
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-answer">
            <p>
              Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event
              listener to a parent element and handle events on its children
              using event bubbling.
